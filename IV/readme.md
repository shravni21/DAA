    <strong>Exhaustive search</strong>
</p>
<p align="center">
    Exhaustive search is simply a brute- force approach toÂ combinatorial problems.
    <br />
 It suggests generating each and every element of the problem domain,<br /> selecting
those of them that satisfy all the
constraints, <br />and then finding a desired
element <br />(e.g., the one that optimizes some objective function).
